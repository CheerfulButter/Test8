# Test 8
At the end of 1st quarter, we started to design and program an Android App that will function for the convenience of students, but we never got far because of our schedules. The app will show the school events calendar, the schedule for each classes, a link to spreadsheet where students can order Mr. Heebner’s coffee, and much more.
About the Application:
The application will include the following:
Coffee Ordering
Already talked to Mr. Heebner,
Orders will be subtracted from pre-deposited money
Students won’t need to go to coffee store until order is ready
No class time is wasted waiting at the Coffee Store.
Tea/Restaurant Information of locals.
See the Menu of local restaurants
See the Phone number of local restaurants
See the address and connect to google maps for direction
(we could potentially do much more with outside integration once we get the rest of the app figured out, such as sending tea orders directly to a tea shops computer systems)
See Announcements
Connected to the school’s website to see updated announcements
Integrated video announcements from MAT Media
Stuco announcements will be shown
Events on weekends/Games
Calendar, Schedules and Notifications
School calendar integrated
Shows the student's current school schedule (can also send notifications)
e.i. Notification at the end of 4th period telling if 5th is A or B
e.i Notification on Sunday night telling if Monday is A or B
Direct notification to specific students by teachers (etc, meeting during lunchtime)
